## What is Hypervisor?
- aka virtualization technology
- Virtualization Technology
   - is a combination of Hardware and software solution
  Intel
    - x86 (32 bit processors)
    - x86 ( set of CPU 32-bit CPU Instructions - invented by Intel )
    - x64 64-bit CPU Instructions is cross-licensed by Intel from AMD
    - Virtualization Feature is called VT-X
    
  AMD
    - x86 - Intel's 32 bit CPU Instructions are cross-licensed by AMD
    - x64 (64-bit processors)
    - x64 ( set of 64-bit CPU Instructions invented by AMD )
    - Virtualization Feature is called AMD-V
 - every processor that you find in market, pretty much supports Hypervisors
 
 - Your Laptop/Desktop/Workstation/Server BIOS should also support Virtualization
 - Make sure your Laptop BIOS settings shows up the Virtualization Feature Enabled
 - Virtualization Softwares
   - there are 2 types
     1. Type1 
        - meant for Workstations & Servers
        - aka bare-metal hypervisors
        - they don't need an OS to install this type of Hypervisor
     2. Type2
        - meant to be used in Laptops/Desktops/Workstations
        - it requires Host OS ( Windows, Mac OS-X, Linux )
        - Type2 can only be installed on top of a Host OS
        - 
    - VMWare
     - VMWare Wokstation ( Linux, Mac OS-X & Windows ) - Type 2 - Hypervisor
     - VMWare Player ( Windows ) - Type 2 Hypervisor
     - VMWare vSphere/v-center ( Type 1 - Hypervisor )
     - VMWare Fusion ( Mac OS-X) - Type 2 
   - Microsoft
     - Hyper-v
   - Oracle
     - VirtualBox( Free for Personal & Commercial use )
   - Parallels ( Mac OS-X)
 
 ## Virtual Machine Overview?
 - aka Guest OS
 - each VM get's its own dedicated
    - CPU Cores
    - RAM
    - Storage
    - Virtual Network Card(s)
    - Virtual Graphics Card(s)
 - each VM has a fully functional Operating System
 - has dedicated Kernel
 
 ## Operating System within VM
 - it has dedicated hardware resources
 - it has dedicated Network/Graphics Card
 - has one or more application processes
 - has its own OS Kernel
 - it supports command prompt in case of Windows, shell prompts ( bash, sh in case of Unix/Linux)

## What is a Linux namespace?
- its an isolated virtual sandbox environment
- every container runs in its namespace
- every container has its own port namespace
- every container has its network namespace i.e a dedicated network stack (7 OSI Layers)

 ## Container Technology
 - is a software technology
 - it is an application virtualization technology
 - containers are nothing but application process 
 - containers are not Operating System
 - containers shares the hardware resources available on the Host machine where containers are running
 - each container - runs one single application
 
 ## Container Image
 - a blueprint of a container
 - from developer point of view, Container Image is like a user-defined Class
 - from a single container image, many containers can be created
 - Example
    - ubuntu:16.04 
    - centos:8
 - the above images just have some shell like bash, sh, etc
 - it comes file system ( files and folders )
 - it comes with package manager ( apt-get/apt, yum, etc., )
 - it has no Kernel or OS
 - containers runs on top of some Operating System
 - all containers that runs on the same system shares hardwares and os Kernel
 
 ## Containers
 - is an instance of Container Image
 - from developer point of view, its an Object of some class
 
## Docker Overview
- is a container software from Docker Inc 
- is developed in Go programming language
- comes in 2 flavors
  1. Community Edition (CE) - opensource(Free)
  2. Enterprise Edition (EE) - Requires License/Commercial use
- follows client/server architecture
- client tool (docker)
- server tool (dockerd - application container engine/docker daemon)

## Docker Registry
- has many Docker Images
- It is thru images one can create containers
- Three types
  1. Local Registry ( local folder where Docker Server is running )
  2. Private Registry ( Setup using Sonatype Nexus or JFrog Artifactory )
  3. Remote Registry ( Docker Hub Website maintained by Docker Inc )

## JFrog Artifactory
- this server can be used multiple ways using its web interface
- can be used like a modern FTP Server that hosts application binaries
- application binaries can be download/uploaded manually/programatically
- also servers a repository server
  - it can be setup within your organization as an Ubuntu apt repository server ( application installer )
  - it can be setup within your organization as a CentOS/RHEL yum repository server
- as Private Container Registry
  - you can host your Propriertary Container Images
  - Your Private Images will have your application and its dependent libraries/fraweworks, etc

# Ansible
- comes in two flavors
  1. Ansible Core (Command line interface only ) - OpenSource
  2. Ansible Tower ( RedHat Enterprise Product built on top of Ansible Core)
- configuration management tool like Puppet, Chef, Salt/SaltStack
- developed in Python by Ansible Inc organization
- it is used by DevOps Engineers to automate software installation, configuration management, etc.,
- use may provision containers locally,  provision aws/azure ec2 instances
- the script that write is called Ansible Playbook ( YAML file )

## Ansible Playbook
- can build a Custom Docker Image using Dockerfile you supply
- can provision a container with your Custom Image with basic tools pre-installed
- can install, configure the container post the container is provisioned
- can be used to provision a container locally or on cloud
- can be used to provision an ec2 instance

## Custom Docker Image
- uses some exiting Docker Image as a base Image
- customize by installing additional software tools that you need for your specific applicaiton build/test/etc
-

# Example
- let's say you have a spring-boot java application
- to compile this spring java application
  - you need a build system( VM/Container/Ec2 Instance )
  - the build machine must have the below 
    - Java Development Kit
    - Ant/Maven/Gradle Build tool is required
    - your application source code

## CI/CD DevOps Pipeline
- when Java/C# application source code is committed into GitHub or similar version control
- Jenkins Job can be setup to monitor your application code repository within GitHub
- Jenkins Job constantly monitors for code changes committed in a particular code repo
- When Jenkins Job detects code changes, it can trigger an Ansible Playbook to provision the build machine 
- the newly configured build system will be used to perform the application build
- As part of application build, it compilers, perform automated tests, package and the binaries will be
  deployed into JFrog Artifactory
- As part of the CI/CD pipeline, it is also possible to create custom Docker images from some base Docker Image, copying
  your application binaries into it along with its dependencies(lib)
- From the JFrog custom Docker Image you can deploy your containerized applications

## Creating your first container
```
docker run hello-world:latest
```

<pre>
(jegan@tektutor.org)$ <b>docker run hello-world:latest</b>

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

To list the nginx container, you need to open another terminal tab as we launched nginx web server in interactive mode
```
docker ps
```

Find the IP address of the nginx container
```
docker inspect <nginx-container-id> | grep IPA
docker inspect <nginx-container-name> | grep IPA
```

Access the nginx web page
```
curl 172.17.0.3
```
In the above command, 172.17.0.3 is the nginx container IP, it might vary for you.


## Deleting a container that is not running
```
docker rm <container-id>
docker rm <container-name>
```

## Deleting a running container gracefully
```
docker stop <container-name>
docker rm <container-name>
```

## Deleting a running container forcibly
```
docker rm -f <container-name>
```

## Getting inside a running container
```
docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash
```
Some containers won't support bash, you may replace /bin/bash with /bin/sh in that case.

## Deleting multiple exited containers
```
docker rm <container-name-1> <container-name-2> <container-name-3>
```

## Deleting multiple exited containers without using their names
```
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

## Deleting all containers in your system forcibly
```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```

## Deleting all containers in your system gracefully
```
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

## Renaming a container
```
docker rename <old-container-name> <new-container-name>
```

## Restarting a container

This might be useful, let's say you update some web server config file, etc.,
To apply config changes, you may have to reboot the container, in such cases this command comes in handy.

```
docker restart <container-name>
```

IP addresses of container are subject to change when they are either stop and started or restarted.

## Creating 3 nginx web servers in background mode
```
docker run -d --name web1 --hostname web1 nginx:latest
docker run -d --name web2 --hostname web2 nginx:latest
docker run -d --name web3 --hostname web3 nginx:latest
```

Finding the IP Addresses of web1, web2 and web3 respectively
```
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web1
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web2
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web3
```

Accessing web1, web2 and web3 container nginx pages
```
curl <web1-container-ip>
curl <web2-container-ip>
curl <web3-container-ip>
```

## Deleting an image from local docker registry
```
docker rmi hello-world:latest
```

## Volume Mounting - storging mysql db and table recorded in an external storage
```
mkdir -p /tmp/mysql
docker run -d --name db1 --hostname db1 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root@123 -v /tmp/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql:latest
```

Expected output

## Load Balancer example
```
docker run -d --name web1 --hostname web1 nginx:latest
docker run -d --name web2 --hostname web2 nginx:latest
docker run -d --name web3 --hostname web3 nginx:latest

docker run -d --name lb --hostname lb -p 80:80 nginx:latest
```
The port on the left represents host machine where the container is running.
The port on the right side represents the container port where nginx is listening.

List the containers and see if all containers are in running state
```
docker ps
```

### We need to copy the nginx.conf from lb container to our local machine to configure it as Load Balancer
```
docker cp lb:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf .
```

Update the nginx.conf file locally with the below content
<pre>
user  nginx;
worker_processes  auto;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;


events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    upstream backend {
        server 172.17.0.2:80;
        server 172.17.0.3:80;
        server 172.17.0.4:80;
    }
    
    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

### Find your web1, web2 and web3 container IPs
```
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web1
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web2
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web3
```

In the above file, you need to replace the IPs with your web1, web2 and web3 IP addresses respectively.
<pre>
172.17.0.2 - nginx web server 1
172.17.0.3 - nginx web server 2
172.17.0.4 - nginx web server 3
</pre>

### Copy the nginx.conf file from local machine to lb container
```
docker cp nginx.conf lb:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

### Restart the lb container to apply config changes
```
docker restart lb
```

### Verify if the lb container is still running after restart
```
docker ps
```

### Let's configure the web1, web2 and web3 index.html to identify which web server is serving us(Optional)
```
echo "Server 1" > index.html
docker cp index.html web1:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

echo "Server 2" > index.html
docker cp index.html web2:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

echo "Server 3" > index.html
docker cp index.html web3:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

### Let's test the lb 
```
curl http://localhost:80
```
If the above curl is not updating the output in round-robin fashion, try localhost from RPS lab machine web browser
